# Expanding Levels
The above are some basic level templates for each seasons. Each includes the level itself, some accessories for the level (such as trees), and backdrops to place in the background. 

It's strongly recommended to import these into Piskel (or another pixel art editing software) to prepare them and _then_ import them into a new Level sprite in Scratch. The reason for this is that Pixel Editing software will line your pixels up perfectly, while Scratch will not. This might not be an issue with floating platforms, but if you try to make a plain horizontal platform or try to make your ground longer, it's difficult to align while in Scratch. Consider the following: 

1) Make a full level screen in Piskel. Note that Scratch uses a 480x360 screen by default, which is a 4:3 ratio. Using sizes like 480x360, 240x180, 160x120, 120x90, etc will work best when expanding to fill the whole Scratch screen. 
2) Make each of the parts you want to use as a template sprite, then put them into Scratch and copy/paste them.  

Each of the BG files are intended for the background, not for the level itself. These can be **layered** in Piskel or in Scratch (though Scratch may require that you use the **Convert to Vector** button) to give different appearances in different scenes.
